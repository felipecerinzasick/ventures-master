    <p>Superior investments require superior insights. Welcome to Sick Ventures. On this Website I reflect, plan, discuss investments of all sorts. The goal is to build an inclusive platform that helps individuals increase their return on investments by leveraging new data sources and thus obtian exponential returns. I firmly believe that capital can be used to do good.

<br>
<br>
I personally believe in a future where investors, like myself use web-data and new technologies to enhance investment decisions, and improve operations in their businesses they are invested in. This is prerequisite to drive change in every aspect of the business landscape. This is why this platform will make an effort to learn, improve and reflect about the latest trends in data-driven investment. Sick Ventures is about making a positive contribution, primarily for individual investors in the European Economic Area (EEA).

Embarking on this journey is an adventurous undertaking. As of this writing, many ideas for this platform are floating in my head. I personally want to invite you on this journey. To explore opportunities for great investments. It requires the minds of smart contributers and thinkers. Having a community of like-minded people is the key.
