    <h1>About Page</h1>
    <p>Sick Leads aims to offer tools that help companies generate more leads online. The goal is to create a platform that helps companies increase their revenue by leveraging web traffic data and boost conversions. Everything on this platform is centered around this goal. In this first entry, I want to provide the outline of what this project is all about.

<br>
<br>
This platform will in the future be a helpful companion for enterprises that want to leverage their web data to understand their customers better. This will allow them to align their business processes accordingly to increase revenues. In the future, it will be possible to obtain automatic recommendations based on best practices for any specific industry.
<br>
<br>
Sick Leads is initiated to serve those entrepreneurs, that aim for a long-term competitive advantage in their online strategy. The mission of this project is to make web-data accessible for every firm in a variety of use cases.
<br>
<br>
I personally believe in a future where businesses use web-processes and new technologies to enhance their business operations to drive change and in an every changing business landscape. This is why this platform will make an effort to learn and improve about the latest integrations. Sick Leads is about making a positive contribution, primarily for organizations in the European Economic Area (EEA), to later serve more companies all around the world.
<br>
<br>
Embarking on this journey is an adventurous undertaking. As of this writing, there are many concepts that will be implemented over time. I personally want to invite you on this journey. To explore opportunities requires the minds of smart contributers. Having a community of open minded people is valuable, and I hope to set the sails together with you on board. Ready to come along?
